# WebNN

WebNN (WNN) is a JavaScript framework for distributed training of Neural Networks (NN). This is a large part of my research, working alongside Ron Cotton into distributed training of neural networks. WNN consists of a NodeJS HTTP server that facilitates the asynchronous distributed training of user-defined NN. It leverages the clients' GPU using TensorFire and WebGL to run and train a NN in any web browser that supports WebGL 1.0 or better--which (as of writing this document) is 96% of browsers in the US and 93% of browsers globally.

I'll be updating this document in a few months at the close of our research with better documentation on just how to use it.
